Koyuki's Bomb - Destroys tiles in a 3x3 area, with the center being two tiles in front of Laro. Can destroy trees, rocks, mushrooms, and other items. Tip: Be careful not to destroy mushrooms as this will result in automatic failure. nihahaha.
Gorilla's Paw - Lets Laro push up to three rocks at once. Power is power. Gorilla is the angel. Violence is the solution to everything.
Make it so that powerups can float on top of water
